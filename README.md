# Hi, I’m @AmmaarIftikhar,

- I completed my postgraduate at USYD in CS . I completed my undergraduate studies from Computer Engineering department, Bilkent University, with high honors or magna cum laude.
- Sometime back, I tried to plunge myself into NLP, Information Theory, and Machine Learning but realized it was just a puddle...
- Now I am trying to drown myself in Cybersecurity + Algorithms + Distributed Systems + Systems Engineering.
